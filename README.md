## _Programaci√≥n Orientada a Objetos POO_

In this project, there is an example of the general way the Uber App works, we have the basic classes that are involved in the logistic of this business.
The step by step video was taken from platzi, there explains how the logic of the movements works, all the objects that compose the stage, possibly actions could happen.

## Features

- A user can request a trip
- A user has to specify the start and the end point of the trip
- The trip has involved the user, the driver, and has to return a tax for the service
- The driver can register his car on the platform
- There are different types of cars that offer the services, not all cars are admitted in some categories of Uber



## Tech

The general structure was coded in each of four different languajes:

- [Java] - the principal language used
- [Java Script] - checking the code from this view to practice
- [PHP] - 
- [Phyton] -
